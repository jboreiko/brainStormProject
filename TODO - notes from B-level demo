ScribbleNode should be wrapped in a JScrollPane
DONE - Suggest (left) side should shrink dynamically
Path should be copy-able
Find bug: not highlighting ALL results
Too hard to find exact point when you delete a path
.storm files
continuous insertion of nodes button -> doesn't do anything, needs fix
open new project (file -> new)
rename project

possible:
  different colors for different editors
  names display by who is editing a node
  minimap
  an option for StyledNode with no bullets


Presentation idea:
  make projects beforehand
**we should come up with a full brainstorm session to demo
