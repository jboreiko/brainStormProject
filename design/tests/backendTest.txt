System Tests:

Test speed:
	-Ensure that adding, removing, undoing, redoing, and recreating state happen negligably quickly.
	-Ensure that finding goes quickly.
	-Ensure that moving and modifying nodes goes quickly
Test interactions with other parts of the project:
	-Make sure nodes are modified correctly.
	-Make sure the states encode correctly.
Test copying and pasting:
	-Make sure pasting gives a copy of the most recently copied item.
Test compression:
