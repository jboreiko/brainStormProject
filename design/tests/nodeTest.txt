Our testing plan should have specific actions to ensure correctness of each node.
The different nodes we will support are bubble nodes, square nodes, and drawing nodes. We will also support paths between each node.
We wish to avoid testing by manually clicking and dragging an application because we would like to separate Swing functionality from node functionality.
Therefore, I will create separate classes that will manually instigate callback methods that are usually only called by Swing.

Bubble nodes:
  A test class that will:
	Create a Bubble instance
	call appendText(String) on that bubble.
		call getText() on that bubble and ensure it worked.

Square Node:
	appendText(String), getText();
	bulleting, numbering
	
Scribble Node:
	manually add lines to the box
	make sure we're selecting colors right
	line extends past the edges of this scribble	
	

General node (cross-node functionality) tests:
	+1 functionality should work
	attach nodes together with a manually created Path object
		check that they link to each other. 
	simulate moving a node, make sure node location adjusts
	infinite applications of undo (more than the number of actions) should not break our nodes
