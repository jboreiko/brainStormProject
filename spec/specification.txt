This will hold the main specification for BrainStorming.  All other files within this folder will be referenced by this document.

the user can create nodes (square windows to be filled with content) or paths (lines between nodes that denote connections, for example)
nodes and paths are called elements

types of nodes:
scribble node - a small painting area with different colors and stroke sizes
text node - a small writing area with different fonts, colors, and font sizes, and an option to have bullet points

types of paths:
path (solid line, no arrow head)
dotted path (dotted line, no arrow head)
arrow (solid line, arrow head)
dotted arrow (dotted line, arrow head)

=============

Features (these go in the 'classic menu bar'):
--------
File: create, join, rename, load, save, exit
create = create a new project (in a new window)
join = join a project over a network
rename = rename a project
load = load a saved project from file
save = save a current project to file
exit = exit the program

Edit: undo, redo
undo = undo the latest action
redo = redo the latest action

(in the left side, a tabbed pane)
Research Panel - a panel where the user can research
Networking Panel - a panel where the user can connect to other users and collaborate over a network
Find Panel - a panel where the user can search for text in the project

=============

On Start Up:
-----------
Blank brainstorming session. User can immediately interact with the project to begin working on it.

============

Interacting with the project background (i.e. clicking not on a ndoe):
----------------------------
rightClick -> sub action menu (insert node menu)
	   option for continuous insertion (which means left clicking several times keeps adding more instances of the last type of element you added)
	   options of elements to add:
	   types of nodes:
	   	text box
	   	scribble box
	   types of paths:
		path
		dotted path
		arrow
		dotted arrow
	   paste (paste the last node that was cut or copied)
leftClick -> drag the project space to pan around instead of using the scroll bars

============

Interacting with nodes:
-----------------------
rightClick on border -> sub action menu
	    option to copy
	    options of paths to add: (these paths will automatically attach to the node they are spawned from)
		path
		dotted path
		arrow
		dotted arrow
	   
leftClick on border -> in top left (red square): delete
	     in bottom right (grey square): resize
	     anywhere else on the border (followed by dragging): move

rightClick inside -> sub action menu
	scribble nodes: color - choose a color to paint
			size - choose a stroke size to use
	text nodes: font - choose a font
		    color - choose a color
		    size - choose a font size
		    turn on bullets - choose whether a new line begins with a bullet point
		    insert wiki info - put text from the currently-searched wikipedia article into this node
		    insert dictionary info - put text from the currently-searched dictionary definition into this node
		    insert duckduckgo info - put text from the currently-searched duckduckgo page into this node
===========

Interacting with Paths:
------------------------
When the mouse moves near a path, colored spots are highlighted to show where the mouse must click and drag to interact with it.

leftClick ->
	if on either end of the path, begins dragging the path. the path stops dragging upon release.
	if in the center (red, delete area), deletes the path

rightClick -> does nothing, treats as a right click on the project space

When an end of a path is dragged into a side of a node, it "snaps" onto it, meaning that until that side of the path
is dragged off the node, it will follow the node around as if that end is glued on. This "snap" is signified to the user
by a big circle at the relevant end of the path.

===========

Research Panel:
------------
The user types in a query and can receive information about it from wikipedia, google dictionary, and duckduckgo.
As has been mentioned, the user can then right click on any text node to copy that information into it.
The user can also, with one click, go to the wikipedia page for the given query in their browser window.

Networking Panel:
------------
The user can either host a brainstorm, where other users can connect to their project and collaborate remotely, or
join a brainstorm that is being hosted by someone else. When in a group brainstorm, the user sees the usernames of
others in the brainstorm, and can chat with them.

Find Panel:
-----------
The user can search for a text query in all the text nodes.
